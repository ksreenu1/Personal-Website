Simulation of neuronal and ECG activity after clinically induced asystole using Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) using StimuLink. Estimated the threshold amplitude and time duration of the electrical stimulation of the Vagus nerve required to arrest the heart by modeling neurons and heart muscles in MATLAB
