Designing, developing and manufacturing MRI conditional RF Ablation catheters along with a software interface for tracking the catehters inside the human body using impedance based tracking electrodes. These are used in EP procedures to treat life-threatening arrhythmias (Atrial Fibrillation, Ventricular tachycrdias, pre-ventricular contractions, etc.,.).
