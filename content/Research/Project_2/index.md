Devised an automatic, high-throughput, portable digital pathology slide scanner which can generate digital images of eight standard microscopic slides. The motivation behind the project was the dire pathological diagnostic needs during COVID-19 when access to laboratories was extremely difficult. 85% of the device operation can be remotely controlled by a pathologist.
