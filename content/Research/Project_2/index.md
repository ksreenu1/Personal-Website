I volunteered at the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/labs/lima-lab"> Lima Lab </a> from September 2019- June 2020. I developed UTE (Ultra-fast Time of Echo) sequences for rapid MR cardiac imaging. The goal was to develop this imaging sequence for efficient tissue separation characteristics while completely eliminating the need for contrast agents which have long-term deleterious effects.
