Mental Stress is associated with coherent variations in Heart rate and Pulse rate changes in individuals. The goal of this project was to associate various statistical HRV and PRV parameters to three levels of mental stress and standardize them. A universally accepted PSS-10 stress test was utilized to catergorize stress levels in 100 individuals aged between 20-24 years and were compared to HRV/PRV parameters obtained from the Biopac Multi-parameter measurement device.
