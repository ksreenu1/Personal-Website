 With  motivation from the cocktail party effect, my team and I proposed three different networks- Convolution (CNN), Deep (DNN), and Recurrent (RNN) neural network in an approach to improve the ability of hearing aids to improve listening ability in complex acousitc environments. The goal of the project was to improvise on the already existing simpler method. Accuracies were tested for each network based on the correlation between the original and reconstructed audio signals.
