The goal of the project was to improvise on the already existing simpler method. Accuracies were tested for each network based on the correlation between the original and reconstructed audio signals.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-15","title":"Diagnostic gloves for stroke rehabilitation","tech":["tracking files","StringTie","Long-reads"],"github":"https://github.com/Siddhi-Nargund/Dealing-with-Biological-File-Formats/blob/master/StatsFasta.py","external":"#","company":null},"html":"<p>Designed a glove consisting of flex sensors and pressure sensors to diagnose improvements in hand strength and flexibility in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-12-01","title":"Analysing Heart rate and Pulse rate parameters with changes in common emotions","tech":["Biomedical Signal Processing","Sensors and Measurements","Statistical Analysis"],"github":"#","external":"#","company":null},"html":"<p>Identified and analysed various statistical Heart rate and Pulse rate parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, HF/LF ratios) in response to transition in basic human emotions (happiness, sorrow and anger) from 60 subjects.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"#","title":"An improvised CPAP machine for pulmonary applications","tech":["Biomedical Instrumentation","Analog electronics","Pulmonary assistive devices"],"github":"#","external":"#","company":null},"html":"<p>Devised a an advanced, economic and user-friendly CPAP machine for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

The goal of this project was to associate various statistical HRV and PRV parameters to three levels of mental stress and standardize them. A universally accepted PSS-10 stress test was utilized to catergorize stress levels in 100 individuals aged between 20-24 years and were compared to HRV/PRV parameters obtained from the Biopac Multi-parameter measurement device.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
